## Abstract

Forecasting COVID-19 incidents is a trending research study in todayâ€™s world. Since Machine learning models have been occupied in forecasting recently, this study focus on comparing statical and machine learning models such as ARIMA, RNN, LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Stacked LSTM. The performances were evaluated using two loss functions, namely, AIC and RMSE. The results showed that RNN performs with the lowest RMSE with -49.5% compared with the ARIMA. Seq2Seq scored the highest correlation of determination (R2) with 0.92.
